It ovides modular components and end-to-end tools that help developers build complex All applications, such as chatbots, question-answering systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), autonomous agents, and more. 


1. Supports all the major LLMs 2. Simplifies developing LLM based applications 3. Integrations available for all major tools 4.Open source/Free/Actively developed 5. Supports all major GenAl use cases Open source/Free/Actively developed 5. Supports all major GenAl use cases.

2. LLMs - General-purpose models that is used for raw text generation. They take a string(or plain text) as input and returns a string( plain text). These are traditionally older models and are not used much now.
